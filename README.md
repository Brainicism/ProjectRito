Project Rito is a minimalist Android app that simply displays a summoner's ranked match history. It was developed to be used as an alternative to popular web-based match history sites such as [OP.GG](http://na.op.gg/) or [LolKing](lolking.net). Project Rito has two modes: condensed and detailed.

  The default mode is condensed, which is shown while the device's orientation is vertical. This mode displays general information about each match: victory/defeat, KDA, champion played, date, and gamemode type. This is useful for a quick glance of a player.

  The second mode is detailed, which is shown while the device's orientation is horizontal. This mode displays more additional information per match: summoner spells, CS, KDA ratio, gold earned, and the user's trinket.

In the settings menu, the user is able to change the default region, number of matches shown, and the types of games shown. Note that the Riot API only provides data for ranked matches, so normal/bot/event game modes are not available.
