Project Rito is a minimalist Android app that simply displays a summoner's match history. It was developed to be used as an alternative to popular web-based match history sites such as [OP.GG](http://na.op.gg/) or [LolKing](http://www.lolking.net/). Project Rito has two modes: condensed and detailed.


---



  The default mode is condensed, which is shown while the device's orientation is vertical. This mode displays general information about each match: victory/defeat, KDA, champion played, date, and gamemode type. This is useful for a quick glance of a player.

  The second mode is detailed, which is shown while the device's orientation is horizontal. This mode displays more additional information per match: summoner spells, CS, KDA ratio, gold earned, and the user's trinket.

In either mode, you can click on a specific match to open up the official Riot detailed match history page for the specified match within the app.

In the settings menu, the user is able to change the default region, number of matches shown, and the types of games shown. Note that only ranked matches can have their length adjusted beyond 10. The recent 10 option will show non-ranked matches (including featured gamemodes), but is limited to 10 by the Riot API.
